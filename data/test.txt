# Each line starts with a keyword:
# - PARTICLE <x0.x> <x0.y> <fixed>
# particles should be defined before beams because their order 
# implicitly implies the index number used when defining the points in a beam
# - BEAM <p0i (point 0's index)> <p1i (point 1's index)> <isRoad>
# - CAR <x0.x> <x0.y> <mass> <damping> <radius> <finish point.x> <finish point.y> <v0>
# including the car line will simulate the car too
# GLOBAL mass, alpha, damping, radius, and threshold of bridge
